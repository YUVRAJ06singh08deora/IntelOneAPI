## A Brief of the Prototype:
This prototype aims to showcase the unique capabilities of LEDs in enhancing road safety during low-light and dark conditions. The primary goal of this technology is to effectively illuminate the road while minimizing glare for both oncoming and preceding traffic. The project achieves this objective through the seamless integration of two interconnected subsystems. The first subsystem is responsible for controlling the LED matrix hardware, while the second subsystem utilizes a camera feed coupled with a trained object detection model. This combination enables the system to accurately detect vehicles, ascertain their positions, and determine optimal lighting adjustments to ensure proper visibility. By employing these interconnected subsystems, the project demonstrates the potential of LEDs to create a safer driving environment without plagiarizing existing content.
